Star Wars Game Homework by Cara Felise


This Star Wars Game is like an RPG game where the player assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game. The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture. Whenever the player clicks `attack`, their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose `HP` (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture. The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture. The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters. Users just have to restart the game when game is over.

The project is useful because it provides an example of languages/technologies I learned and show what I can do as a developer. It is using JQuery, some HTML and CSS.

For questions or concerns, please go to my website at carafelise.com or send an email at admin@carafelise.com. I maintain and developed this project.
